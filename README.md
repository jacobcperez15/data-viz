# data-vizualization
For this group project, we merged a prescription data set with a dataset that had the average number of deaths from 
overdoses and population counts from five states in the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Ohio). 

From this data, we wanted to determine if there was a link between the prescription data and overdoses. 
For example, do states that have lower prescription costs have a higher number of overdoses per state population? 

The first data set was on prescription patterns by state. 
The data provided information on coverage (HMO, PPO, Medicare), prescription costs (ingredient cost), prescription date, and drug name. 
If we see a potential link between prescribing practices and overdoses we could further look into specific opiate medications and see 
if there are a higher number of opiate prescriptions in states that have a higher number of overdoses in the population to determine 
if we can attribute prescription practices to the overdose related deaths.

The second data set we used contained overdose related information for the United states, with numbers from each state. 
Since overdoses are a rising trend in the United States which has led to many deaths of teens and early adults, 
we also sought to find a potential link between prescription practices across various coverage types and overdoses.

By combining these data sources, we are seeking to find a potential link between drug cost and overdose related deaths and 
how the varying drug cost by differing coverages may lead to overdoses in the Midwest. 

From our data we have hypothesized that states that have a lower cost for prescriptions have a lower rate of overdoses than states with higher prescription costs.
